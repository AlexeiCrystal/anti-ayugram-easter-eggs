# Description

The ExteraGram plugin protects against opening AyuGram Easter eggs _(tg://ayu/... train, xiaomi, relax, augh, pipe, saul, komaru, lobster)_

_You can see all easter eggs in [@ayugram_easter](https://t.me/ayugram_easter)_

# Requirements
- AyuGram 20250612 and above (Based on ExteraGram 11.12.0 and above)

# How It Works

The plugin intercepts links that use the `tg://ayu/...` format. It checks them against a predefined list of Easter eggs. If a link leads to an Easter egg, the plugin blocks it from opening and instead displays a notification dialog.
